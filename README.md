# OpenAI_ChatBot

This repository houses a custom implementation of an OpenAI chatbot with memory up to the token limit. The current implementation was written in January 2023 and utilizes 2048 tokens by default. The script could easily be updated to use more recent models from OpenAI with higher token limits.
